Project 3

I still get blue screens every so often, I have been backing up my project on an external device to stop losing everything. If it happens to you I apologize, but a new project should fix it.

My project hs 5 activities.

Login: User can login. Either the email/password exist and they are taken to the user list, or it doesn't and they recieve a toast. They can also click to create a new account.

New Account: User enters their information. It is split up and stored in the apropriate entities in room.

User List: Lists the users. If they're a favorite or themselves there is text to show that. Clicking on a user brings up their profile.

User Profile: A users profile shows all their information, as well as has a button to change if they're a favorite.

Feed: Shows the feed of favorited users using a custom adapter. There is no preview of the photo if they want to post, but if it is taken when they click post it is posted.

Extra Credit: 

Due to my blue screen issues I didn't have time to iplement what we talked about. All I did were some small ui things to make it flow better. These include having a temporary profil picture, previewing the profile picture with the ability to take a new one, including which users made which posts on the feed, ect. Not sure if these warrant anything but thought I would mention them in case.
